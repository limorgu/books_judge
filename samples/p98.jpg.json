  "text": "Laurel Braitman\n\nOne day, while scrolling Instagram, in between ads for pointy flats, made of recycled cups and photos of my friends’ goofy kids, I came across a Bruce Lee quote: “I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.” The rightness of this hit me in my calluses, the ones I’d gotten from running so hard after what Dad wanted for me. It’s our own expectations for ourselves that should matter the most but knowing this intellectually isn’t nearly enough to change the way you live. It took me years to understand that Dad had expected himself to be superhuman and, by extension, me too. He’d survived the craziest of odds. And he didn’t just want to keep Jake and me from thinking of him as sick. He wanted to be powerful, not pitiable. If we acknowledged our own pain or suffering, we’d have to acknowledge his. Which was a kind of treason.\n\nIf another parent at soccer practice or some other well-intentioned acquaintance ever expressed anything approaching concern for him, like “I’m sorry about what you’re going through, Howard,” or “it must be really tough,” he would actually get angry. “No one is going to feel sorry for us,” he said often enough that I’d learned to think of pity as a useless gift foisted on you by soft-spined people who didn’t understand that bad things happened but that we were just fine, thank you.\n\nSitting in the circle at Josie’s Place I could finally see this more clearly. Or I was beginning to, anyway. Dad didn’t have to choose between being vulnerable or powerful. He could have been a hero and still been in pain. The best heroes are. He might have known this in the beginning but as his disease showed up more often and stayed longer, I think he lost his way a bit. And since I was following so closely at his heels, I got lost too.",
